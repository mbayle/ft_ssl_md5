Ludo:
	- Should we display "stdin" when reading pipes ?

	- If the machine runs out of memory between the allocations of "func_tab"
	and "sizes_tab", the former may leak.

	- Find a way to get rid of display_hash's "is_string" argument ('cause it's
	ugly).

	- Hash sources to clean ?

	- Add missing error messages

	- Find another way to use the "p" option only once ?
